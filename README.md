## About

LendingClub is a peer-to-peer lending services company that allows individual investors to partially fund personal loans as well as buy and sell notes backing the loans on a secondary market. LendingClub offers their previous data through an API. This is what we will be using as data. With this data, I will create a machine learning model to classify the risk level of given loans. 

Specifically, I will be comparing the Logistic Regression model and Random Forest Classifier.

## Setup

The data for this repositry is not given, therefore running this code yourself will require you to gather data with LendingClub's API.
